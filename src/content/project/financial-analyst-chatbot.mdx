## Building a financial analyst chatbot for brokers

**TL;DR** — *I built an AI chatbot to provide fast, contextual financial analysis based on in-house research, enabling brokers to scale personalized client support without scaling headcount.*

This bot answers user questions using a simple methodology:  
✅ Reads the company or industry-specific reports relevant to the question  
✅ Finds the key information needed to answer, if it exists  
✅ Synthesizes an accurate, natural-language answer  
✅ Cites the sources used  

*During testing, we found that using underlying model such as Gemini 2.5 Pro yielded reliable answers, and that the the bot will correctly identify when information is missing to answer.*

### Context and Motivation


**Financial securities brokers help investors make informed decisions**  
-- by publishing research reports via analyst teams  and providing personalized advice through sales representatives.

**The problem? This system doesn’t scale well!**  
While research teams are already busy writing reports, sales teams lack deep expertise or bandwidth to answer every client question in detail.  
**Answering individual client questions is time-consuming and requires expertise, so scaling personalized support with only human teams is inefficient.**


*A Q&A chatbot with access to in-house financial reports can answer technical questions from clients—accurately, instantly, and with source citations.*


### Design Philosophy

✅ **Retrieves the Right Report**

The chatbot uses cues from the user's question (e.g. company name, report date, type) to select the most relevant report from a structured list of reports (e.g. "FPT_Q1Y25.pdf", "FPT_Q2Y25.pdf",...).

✅ **Cites the source**

Every answer comes with the exact report name and section, enabling clients or compliance teams to audit the result.

✅ **Avoid hallucination**

If the answer isn’t available in the report, the chatbot says so—making it reliable for high-stakes environments like finance.

✅ **Understands financial language**

Thanks to a glossary of synonyms and definitions, plus clarification-seeking prompts, the chatbot handles varied client inputs without confusion.


### Agent architecture

There are two main workflows in this system -- **a data ingestion workflow** and a **chatbot workflow (inference)**.

The **data ingestion workflow** takes the raw report PDF files and structure them into readable data when addressing user queries.  Think of it as a file management portal where the admin can upload new reports files to extend the knowledge base of the chatbot.

The **inference workflow** takes user inputs via the chatbot interface, process them by calling a cloud hosted LLM and accessing self-hosted report data if needed, and replies to the user.

The chatbot system is built around a modular function-calling architecture where the model can perform the following actions:
```
- get_date()
- list_reports()
- read_report(report_name)
```

For example:
```
> User asks: “What was the value of FPT in Q1?”
> Bot logic:
        get_date() → "17-07-2025"
        list_reports() → "FPT_Q1Y25.json", "FPT_Q4Y24.json"
        read_report("FPT_Q1Y25.json") → "FPT shares rose to 1000 VND this quarter"
        Answer: "The value of FPT in Q1Y25 is 1000 VND."

```

### Why it matters

This approach is not just a proof-of-concept. It demonstrates that generative AI + structured financial data can:  
▪️Reduce workload on sales and research teams,  
▪️Improve client responsiveness and satisfaction,  
▪️And scale operations without increasing headcount.

For brokers, this is a glimpse of how AI can augment expertise and automate insight delivery.
