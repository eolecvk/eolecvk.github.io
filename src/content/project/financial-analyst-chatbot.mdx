## Building a financial analyst chatbot for brokers

**TL;DR** — *I built an AI chatbot to provide fast, contextual financial analysis based on in-house research, enabling brokers to scale personalized support without scaling headcount.*

This bot:  
✅ Reads company or industry-specific reports  
✅ Finds the correct section  
✅ Synthesizes an accurate, natural-language answer  
✅ Cites the source used

### Context and Motivation


**Financial securities brokers help investors make informed decisions**  
-- by publishing research reports via analyst teams  and providing personalized advice through sales representatives.

**The problem? This system doesn’t scale well!**  
While research teams are already busy writing reports, sales teams lack deep expertise or bandwidth to answer every client question in detail.  
**Answering individual client questions is time-consuming and requires expertise, so scaling personalized support with only human teams is inefficient.**


*A Q&A chatbot with access to in-house financial reports can answer technical questions from clients—accurately, instantly, and with source citations.*


### Design Philosophy

✅ Start simple: Q&A from reports

The chatbot uses cues from the user's question (e.g. company name, report date, type) to select the most relevant report from a structured list of reports (e.g. "FPT_Q1Y25.pdf", "FPT_Q2Y25.pdf",...).


✅ Doesn’t Hallucinate

If the answer isn’t available in the report, the chatbot says so—making it reliable for high-stakes environments like finance.

✅ Cites the Source

Every answer comes with the exact report name and section, enabling clients or compliance teams to audit the result.

✅ Understands Financial Language

Thanks to a glossary of synonyms and definitions, plus clarification-seeking prompts, the chatbot handles varied client inputs without confusion.

*Financial brokers are valuable to their clients because they are a source of market insights.  
These insights are produced by the research team and delivered via reports and through conversation clients have with the broker sales team.  
Offering personalized support to clients is typically expensive as it costs time to the sales team and sometimes the research team.*

**I built an AI chatbots can look up information in financial reports and is able to accurately answer questions about market conditions and about specific companies.**

### Chatbot Decision Workflow

### Key insights

✅ **Reads from relevant reports based on the question**  

One key to building the financial research assistant chatbot is its ability to look up information in the right reports.  
Fortunately, reports are standardized (report type, report date) making it straight forward to infer which report to read based on the focus of the question (industry, company, timeframe).

✅ **Says when information is missing to answer**

Conversely, if the information needed to answer is missing from the sources, we need to evaluate the ability of the chatbot to correctly report that instead of hallucinating an answer.


✅ **Cites the sources of information**

One way to reinforce trust and usefulness of the chatbot is to make information easily auditable. We find that prompting the chatbot to cite the reports containing the answers will work without issue (no RAG needed). This is in part thanks to the effectiveness of our approach to read from relevant reports in the first place.


✅ **Understands financial terms**

We connect expect all client to use a standardized list of terms which means that giving a large list of synonym and disctionary of definition to the chatbot will improve the user experience.  
It also makes sense to build in a clarification-seeking mechanism as part of the system prompt for the chatbot to avoid assumption in case the user query is ambiguous.
