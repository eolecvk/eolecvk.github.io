## Building an AI analyst for a financial broker

TL;DR -- ***I built a chatbot that can look up information in financial reports produced by a research team and is able to answer questions about market conditions and about specific companies.
The solution leverages LLMs and custom tools to read relevant reports based on the questions. It knows financial definitions, acronyms, cite its sources and says when it does not know something!***
