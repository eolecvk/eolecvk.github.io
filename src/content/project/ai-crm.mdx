## What I learned from building an AI-powered CRM

A small business asked me to help them build a self-hosted CRM managed by an AI agent.
I build an AI workflow that would update the client opportunities pipeline based on incoming emails.
I then exposed an AI chatbot so client can query the CRM using natural language.

Project code available here : https://github.com/eolecvk/trustlink-workflow

### Some context

My goal was to help a small legal office streamline their CRM workflow.
Some of the requirements I gathered from them (which I think applies to a lot of SMBs):
* **simplicity** : they are not technologists and do not want to be
* **maintaining control of their data** : as lawyers, they deal with confidential data and want to be able to guarantee their client data does not leak
* **Potential for automation** : The primary purpose of the CRM is not to scale the number of client but to remove repetitive tasks such as CRM related reporting and client pipeline management overhead

*Importantly they want to avoid vendor lock-in with a commercial solution that could raise prices on a whim and leave them with no other option than to pay; this point was so important that they actually used an MS Excel spreadsheet as their primary CRM*.

### The project
