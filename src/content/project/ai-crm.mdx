## Building an AI Assistant for a Legal Team

TL;DR -- ***I used AI to automate the Client Relationship Management (CRM) for a legal team.  
The solution leverages LLMs and integrates with MS Outlook and a self-hosted CRM to automate administration and reporting of client opportunities.***

The design prioritizes **simplicity** (non-technical users needed to operate and manage the system), **data ownership** (confidential legal data must remain under their control), and to **avoid vendor lock-in** (open system, independent of any specific SaaS vendor).

[The project code available on GitHub](https://github.com/eolecvk/trustlink-workflow) includes scripts for integrating Microsoft Graph API, and the logic for triggering CRM updates based on incoming emails.


### Features

**Implemented**  
✅ Extract key client and opportunities information from emails and update the CRM accordingly  
✅ Automatically generate notes and tasks linked to each case based on internal workflow specifications  


**Upcoming**  
⏳ **Write case summaries** -- for internal coordination and client briefings.  
⏳ **CRM AI chatbot** -- enable chatbot to leverage the CRM API to find information about client cases and answer questions.  
⏳ **User Access Management** -- leveraging Microsoft and Twenty CRM user access control, one major feature to implement is the ability to define user specific roles in the CRM system.


### Tech stack
🔧 **MS Graph API** -- integrating with Outlook and Sharepoint  
🔧 **Twenty CRM API** -- Update Opportunities, Client, Tasks, Notes in CRM
