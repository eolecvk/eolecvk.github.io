## Building an AI assistant for a legal team

TL;DR -- ***I used AI to automate the Client Relationship Management (CRM) for a legal team.  
The solution leverages LLMs and integrates with MS Outlook and a self-hosted CRM to automate administration and reporting of client opportunities.***

[The project code available on GitHub](https://github.com/eolecvk/trustlink-workflow) includes scripts for integrating Microsoft Graph API, and the logic for triggering CRM updates based on incoming emails.

The design prioritizes **simplicity** (non-technical users needed to operate and manage the system), **data ownership** (confidential legal data must remain under their control), and to **avoid vendor lock-in** (open system, independent of any specific SaaS vendor).


**Core features:** 
âœ… Extract key client and opportunities information from emails and update the CRM accordingly  
âœ… Automatically generate notes and tasks linked to each case based on internal workflow specifications  
âœ… Write case summaries and context reports for internal coordination and client briefings.

**Upcoming features:**  
âœ… **CRM AI chatbot** -- current workflow ensures that the CRM system gets updated with latest case information with incoming emails. The CRM becomes a structured source of context for the LLM to generate reports or answer questions. AI assitant can then leverage the CRM API to find information about client cases as needed and answer questions.  
âœ… **User Access Management** -- leveraging Microsoft and Twenty CRM user access control, one major feature to implement is the ability to define user specific roles in the CRM system.


**Tech stack:**    
ðŸ”§ MS Graph API (for integrating with MS Outlook, Sharepoint)  
ðŸ”§ Twenty CRM (open source, self-hosted)  
ðŸ”§ LLM engine (eg: Gemini Pro)
